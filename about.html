    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>I'm a Software Engineer based in downtown Chicago working primarily on RESTful services and React single page web
        applications. More than anything I enjoy pursuing my own ventures, and building top notch services that can make
        other people's lives easier.</p>

    <p>This blog is hosted on
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">AWS S3</a>,
        with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/moodysalem/blog">Travis</a>
        and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>
        for building and deploying the blog, and <a href="https://github.com/moodysalem/blog">Github</a> for version control.</p>
